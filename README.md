# Disparity-Index-Data-Storage-and-Code
This repository contains the code, data, and files used in "Quantifying Disparities in Public Potable Water and Wastewater Systems using a Disparity Index."
This repository contains the following files:

Excel fileS of the data used in the Drinking Water Disparity Index

Excel fileS of the data used in the Wastewater Disparity Index

Meta files used for the Drinking Water Disparity Index and Wastewater Disparity Index

Example data files and meta files for others to use

R Code used to run the analysis for both of the Disparity Indices

Here is a list of packages used in this analysis, as well as who created them and where to find more information about them:
